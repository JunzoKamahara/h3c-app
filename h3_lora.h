/* LoRA adapters for the MiniMax-H3 DiT.
 *
 * Loading normalizes every published H3 LoRA layout onto the engine's own
 * weights. Those are the official checkpoint's, which differ from the
 * ComfyUI repack in one place: attn.qkv_proj rows are interleaved per head
 * ([q_h, k_h, v_h] for each of the 56 heads), while ComfyUI - and so every
 * LoRA trained or converted for it - stores them contiguously ([Q; K; V]).
 * diffusers/PEFT adapters split the projection into to_q/to_k/to_v (each
 * contiguous) and store ff.net.0.proj as [value; gate] where mlp.fc1 is
 * [gate; value]. out_proj and fc2 match everywhere.
 *
 * Adapters are applied by adding delta = sum_i s_i * B_i @ A_i to each
 * projection's weight on the GPU when the block is loaded (resident
 * weights) or every time it is streamed in (int8 attention cache, SSD
 * streaming). Stacked adapters are concatenated along the rank, so N
 * adapters cost one matmul per row group, not N. */
