## ccv (linked into builds made with `CCV_DIR`, including the release .dmg)

The optional fast mode (高速モード) links [liuliu/ccv](https://github.com/liuliu/ccv)'s
`libccv.a` into the app, built from commit
`6a611be1aab6470ae279115ae4eaf7e01bc87135` with the patches in
[tools/ccv_eval](tools/ccv_eval/README.md). ccv itself is under the
BSD-3-Clause license reproduced above (Copyright (c) 2010, Liu Liu). ccv's
`COPYING` file also carries the licenses of the third-party code ccv bundles
(among them Apple's metal-cpp under the Apache License 2.0); builds made
with `CCV_DIR` ship that file unchanged as
`h3c-app.app/Contents/Resources/ccv-COPYING.txt`.
