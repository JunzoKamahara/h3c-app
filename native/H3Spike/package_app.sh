# The app is named H3cApp everywhere the user sees it - the bundle folder,
# the executable inside it, Info.plist - while the repository is h3c-app.
# The bundle ID (dev.kamahara.h3c-app), the UserDefaults keys and the
# Application Support folder keep the h3c-app spelling so existing
# settings, presets and downloaded models carry over.

# tree sidesteps it entirely (verified: reliable across many consecutive
# builds, vs. frequent failures at the in-tree default path).
